  <h1>Boost Me! – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 2 August 2025</em></p>

  <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>Boost Me!</strong> (“the App”). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>Boost Me! is developed and published by <strong>Manuel Radons</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). For any privacy-related questions, please contact <a href="mailto:manuel.radons.dev@gmail.com">boostmeappcontact@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Scope of this policy</h2>
  <p>This Policy applies to all versions of the Boost Me! Android application distributed through Google Play Store and any other official channels.</p>

  <h2>3. Data we collect</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Category</th><th>Details</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Stored where</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Device Identifiers</strong></td>
        <td>Google Advertising ID and other non-personal identifiers automatically gathered by Google AdMob SDK</td>
        <td>Serve and personalise ads; detect fraud &amp; abuse</td>
        <td>Collected and processed by Google</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Usage Data</strong></td>
        <td>Aggregate analytics supplied by Google Play (e.g., crashes, installs, anonymous statistics)</td>
        <td>Improve stability and performance</td>
        <td>Google Play Console (aggregated, no direct access to personal data)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>In-App Preferences</strong></td>
        <td>Favourite boosts, dismissed boosts, volume level, theme, alarm schedules</td>
        <td>Provide core functionality &amp; remember your settings</td>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><strong>We do not collect:</strong> names, email addresses, location data, contacts, photos, microphone recordings or any other personally identifiable information (“PII”).</p>

  <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
  <p>The App integrates the following third-party SDKs, each governed by its own privacy terms:</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Service</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Links</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Google AdMob &amp; Google Mobile Ads SDK</strong></td>
        <td>Display banner advertisements</td>
        <td>
          <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob Privacy &amp; Terms</a>,
          <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Google may collect device information (e.g., Advertising ID, IP address) to deliver and measure ads. You can opt out of personalised advertising in <em>Android Settings ▸ Privacy ▸ Ads ▸ Delete Advertising ID</em> or <em>Opt out of Ads Personalisation</em>.</p>

  <h2>5. Permissions the App requests</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Permission</th><th>Why it is needed</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code> (Android 13 +)</td>
        <td>Show scheduled alarms and motivational reminders in your notification shade</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</code></td>
        <td>Trigger alarms exactly at the time you set</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>The App functions if you deny these permissions, although alarms and notifications may be limited.</p>

  <h2>6. How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core features such as displaying boosts, saving favourites, and scheduling alarms.</li>
    <li>Display non-personalised or personalised ads (subject to your Android ad-personalisation setting).</li>
    <li>Diagnose crashes and improve performance (aggregated statistics only).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We <strong>do not</strong> sell or rent any data. We do not transfer locally stored data off your device.</p>

  <h2>7. Legal basis for processing (GDPR)</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Processing activity</th><th>Legal basis</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>AdMob advertising</td>
        <td><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> (Art.&nbsp;6 (1)(f)) and/or your <strong>Consent</strong> if required by your region</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Local in-app preferences</td>
        <td><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> – necessary to deliver requested functionality</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Aggregated analytics</td>
        <td><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> – app maintenance and improvement</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>You have the right to withdraw consent at any time (see § 10).</p>

  <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Locally stored data</strong> – kept on your device until you uninstall the App or use the in-app <em>Reset App Data</em> option.</li>
    <li><strong>AdMob / Analytics data</strong> – retained in accordance with Google’s policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>All sensitive operations (favourites, alarms) run entirely on-device. No remote server stores your personal data. Nevertheless, no mobile platform can guarantee absolute security; use the App at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>10. Your rights (EEA/UK &amp; similar jurisdictions)</h2>
  <p>Subject to local law, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Access</strong> the personal data we process about you;</li>
    <li><strong>Rectify</strong> inaccuracies;</li>
    <li><strong>Erase</strong> data in certain circumstances;</li>
    <li><strong>Object</strong> to or <strong>restrict</strong> processing;</li>
    <li><strong>Data portability</strong> for information you provided; and</li>
    <li><strong>Lodge a complaint</strong> with a supervisory authority.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Because we hold no direct identifiers, fulfilling some requests may require you to share your device’s Advertising ID or other proof of use.</p>

  <h2>11. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>Boost Me! is <strong>not directed to children under 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>12. International users</h2>
  <p>Your data may be processed on servers located outside your country. By using the App, you consent to such cross-border processing. Where required, we rely on standard contractual clauses or equivalent safeguards.</p>

  <h2>13. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be announced within the App or via the Google Play listing. Continued use of the App after changes implies acceptance.</p>
